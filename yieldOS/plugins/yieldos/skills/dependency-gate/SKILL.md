# yieldOS Dependency Gate

You are operating in a project protected by **yieldOS**, a security gate that intercepts dependency installations, skill activations, MCP additions, and instruction-file changes.

## Core principles

1. **The user is non-technical and not part of the loop.** Do not ask the user to approve dependencies, skills, or rewrites. yieldOS makes every decision automatically based on its policy.
2. **The official policy lives at `github.com/platanus-hack/platanus-hack-26-ar-team-10/policy/`.** The user cannot edit allowlist or denylist locally — only PRs to the official repo modify them.
3. **Logs are the user's window into yieldOS decisions.** Everything important is appended to `security/dependency-events.md`.

## How to interpret PreToolUse blocks

When yieldOS blocks a `Bash` / `Write` / `Edit` action, it returns a structured stderr message. Possible verdicts:

- `allowlist-match` — never seen here, the action would have run.
- `denylist-match` — bug if you got here; do not retry.
- `category-d-blocked` — package is in a critical category (crypto, auth, frameworks, ORMs, etc.) and not allowlisted. Inform the user that this requires a PR to the official policy repo. Do not attempt rewrite.
- `category-a-rewrite` — small/simple package. yieldOS expects you to perform a local rewrite using the rewriter helper. See "Rewrite flow" below.
- `large-lib-analysis` — large package; yieldOS will run manifest/script/OSV/static analysis. Wait for the analyzer verdict. Do not retry the install.
- `verification-failed` — analysis flagged the package. Inform the user and do not retry.
- `verification-passed` — package is safe; retry the install once.

## Rewrite flow (Category A only)

If yieldOS instructs you to perform a local rewrite:

1. Read the source of truth of the package from its official repo (e.g., `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` at the matching tag).
2. Read `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (the global one) to pick up user-specific style preferences.
3. Read the project's structure: tsconfig, package.json, existing imports, naming conventions, where utilities already live.
4. Generate the local implementation under `src/lib/yieldos/<package-name>/` with:
   - The minimum surface needed by the project (only the imports actually used).
   - Tests that cover the project's actual usage.
   - A header marker: `yieldos-rewrite | source: <type>:<name>@<version> | source-url: <url> | content-hash: <sha256>`.
5. Update `security/yieldos-rewrites.json` with the new entry.
6. After the rewrite is done, surface a single short message to the user: `yieldOS realizó una optimización de la instalación de <package>`.

## Self-defense

yieldOS will block any attempt to:

- Modify files under `.claude/plugins/yieldos/**`.
- Modify `security/dependency-events.md` other than via append from yieldOS itself.
- Modify `security/yieldos-rewrites.json` outside of the rewrite flow.
- Modify the official policy cache.

Do not try to bypass these blocks. They are a feature, not a bug.

## What to tell the user

Keep messages short, in their language, and informative — never asking.

### Visual stamp

Whenever a tool call was processed by yieldOS, close your reply with the matching one-line stamp on its own final line:

| Verdict in stderr | Stamp |
| --- | --- |
| `allowlist-match` | `> 🛡  Validado por yieldOS` |
| `verification-passed` | `> 🛡  Validado por yieldOS (análisis OK)` |
| `denylist-match` | `> ⛔ Bloqueado por yieldOS — denylist` |
| `category-d-blocked` | `> ⛔ Bloqueado por yieldOS — categoría crítica` |
| `verification-failed` | `> ⛔ Bloqueado por yieldOS — señales sospechosas` |
| `build-script-not-approved` | `> ⛔ Bloqueado por yieldOS — build script no aprobado` |
| `native-suggest` | `> 💡 yieldOS sugiere usar API nativa` |
| `category-a-rewrite` | `> ✨ yieldOS optimizó la instalación` |
| `injection-blocked` | `> ⛔ Bloqueado por yieldOS — inyección detectada` |
| `self-defense-block` | `> ⛔ Bloqueado por yieldOS — archivo protegido` |

Use a brief body only when the user needs context:

- Allowed: silent body, just the stamp.
- Blocked (denylist): explain the reason in one line, then stamp.
- Blocked (Category D): say it requires security-team approval, then stamp.
- Rewritten: say yieldOS optimized the install locally, then stamp.
- Verification failed: say yieldOS found suspicious signals and blocked the install, then stamp.
- CVE on transitive: `yieldOS detectó CVE en transitiva {pkg}: {cve_id}`.
